# Super-Resolution-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
# Overview
Welcome to the Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) repository! This code implements an image enhancement model using GANs to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. SRGANs are particularly useful for tasks like upscaling images with improved visual quality or to reduce the noise in an image.
